top-down game created as a clojure learning framework for kids

Work still in progress. Check it out in [here](https://coelias.github.io/juliaworld/)

## Description

This game is a framework to learn programming whilst having fun. It has been inspired by the [code.org minecraft series](https://code.org/minecraft).
However it is written in clojure and it is supposed to also teach clojure to kids.

## Running it locally for development purposes

run `lein run -m figwheel.main -b dev` and it will run in your [browser](http://localhost:9500), enabling live code reloading.

enjoy!
